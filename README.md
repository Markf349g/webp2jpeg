# 🖼️ WebP ➜ JPEG Converter – Effortless CLI Tool with Drag & Drop Magic

A lightweight and cross-platform command-line tool written in **pure Go** for converting `.webp` images to `.jpeg`. Built to simplify workflows where `.webp` is unsupported (e.g., Microsoft Office tools like Excel, Word, PowerPoint).

Just **drag & drop files onto the executable**, and it will output converted `.jpeg` images to the **same folder**.
